h3. Whoa

* mvc
* presenter first
* apple MVC
* router
* interpreter

* go with me on that, reserve judgement until we're done
* not a debate, not yet, rather a presentation
* if everyone got this right away, there'd be no point to the talk
* there are better ways to go about this
* pick apart - but after the presentation
* sit down with Paul Hawke ... and Micah and James
